This is a hackathon boilerplate for new Flask web applications created by [Major League Hacking](https://github.com/MLH). It is for hackers looking to get started quickly on a new hackathon project using the Flask microframework.

This project requires the following tools:

This is a tweaked version with tutorials and other things removed so you can get straight to work!
